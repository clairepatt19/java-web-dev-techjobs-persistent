Your Task
You will be working with the Tech Jobs application. Add ORM functionality by using Spring Data. You are responsible for completing 
the code to allow users to create new job data.

This final application will have the same list and search capabilities as your Tech Jobs (MVC Edition) but youâ€™ll need to do 
the work to connect the project to a database for storing user-submitted job data.

Each of the four sections of this assignment will also ask you to demonstrate your SQL skills under an item labelled SQL TASK.
